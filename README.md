# xps-9575-color-profile
### Introduction
I calibrate and profile my XPS 15 2 in 1(9575) UHD laptop using ColorMunki Display, DisplayCAL 3.6 and ArgyllCMS 2.0.
If you find your laptop over-saturated(wide gamut monitor), you can try my [color profile](./FNVDR-LQ156D1%20%231%202018-07-23%2019-19%20D6500%202.2%20M-S%20XYZLUT%2BMTX.icm). I am still learning calibrating and profiling. If you find some issues about my color profile, please let me know.  

If you are doing professional stuff such as photo editing, you may need to calibrate and profile your laptop yourself since we may have different working environments.  

The profile can partly adjust the display for non color managed software. The profile is effective for color managed software, such as Vivaldi, Chrome, Firefox, Adobe software, GIMP and so on. You may need to explicitly enable the color management for some of them.  

For color managed video playing, refer to [madvr](http://madvr.com/).  
For color managed gaming, refer to [reshade](https://reshade.me/).  
For all applications including color managed and non color managed, use [dwm_lut](https://github.com/lauralex/dwm_lut)
